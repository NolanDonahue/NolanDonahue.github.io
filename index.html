                    </h3>
                    <p>In 7th grade I began rowing at the Wimington Youth Rowing Association.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For the next 8 years I was a coxswain, taking 3 boats to Youth Nationals. I grew from leading a boat of 4 in 7th grade, to a boat of 8 in 8th, to leading the entire Varsity mens team Freshman year of high school through to my graduation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was fortunate to be in a position of leadership early in my life. Consistently put in front of a team and relied on as the subject matter expert, mentoring on and off the water.</p>

                    <p>Freshman year I began studying Finance at the University of Delaware. I joined the Mens Crew team and was a coxswain for the lightweights placing 3rd in the Dad Vails regatta.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Egypt</h3>
                    <p>After completing my Basic Officer Leaders Course, I was deployed overseas to the Middle East in support of a multinational peacekeeping organization. I was in charge of managing the money, pay, and other financial support of 200 US Service Members and over 1000 foreign allies from across 13 different contingents.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, I was solely charged with the maintenance and operation of the Ammunition Supply Point and a dilapidated Education Center. Over the 12 months I was there I installed multiple IT systems improving workflows by 98%, taught English and Math classes, and managed over $500,000 in physical currency with no other leader in Country having Finance experience to provide mentorship.</p>

                    <p>I returned stateside and moved to Fort Bragg. I was charged with the wellbeing and training of 35 Soldiers across Military Pay, Disbursing, and Contracting.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For the next two years, I expanded my influence to create training plans across multiple fiscal years for the training of over 100 Soldiers. In less than 3 months I was able to coordinate, train, and certify 100% of Soldiers in my Company across all Finance domains.</p>

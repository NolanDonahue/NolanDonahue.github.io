                    <p>My name is Nolan Donahue. You can read a brief synopsis about my work <a href="../">at the Home page.</a> Here I'll offer a few bits about how I think and operate. My goal is to show you just as much as tell you about my preparation, achievements, and commitment. Thank you for your time.</p>

                    <h3>My Leadership Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Individuals are strongest when they embrace the triad of failure, reflection, and ownership. Failure is the bedrock of growth and I firmly believe that subordinates should be encouraged to encounter controlled failure. The flock should be shepherded away from wolves while being given the discretion to pick where they may lie. Wanton or redundant failure are the wolves to the flock and must be addressed decisively as cancerous. Meanwhile healthy failure when met with enthusiasm and reflection lead to rapid growth and buy in to the goals at all levels in an organization. The ownership to accept failure of yourself as well as your subordinates shows a depth of understanding to the problems the people and systems of an organization face. When combined this triad is the foundation of a healthy team.</p>
